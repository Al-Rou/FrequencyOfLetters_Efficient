This program delivers the same task as in FrequencyOfLetters repository. However, no list or map is employed here, but simply a two-dimension array.
The result array which is to store the result of the analysis, consists of 26 rows (as the number of English alphabet) and two columns where the first column returns the letter and the second column returns its frequency in the sentence.
